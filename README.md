# üöÄ Asia Butterflies - Backend Environment Creation and Connection with Frontend
The aim of this project is to learn how to create a backend environment that will lately will connected to a frontend. The backend is created from scratch and will be connected to an already pre-existing frontend created by another group in F5. This project will enable us to learn how to properly build a backend following TDD principles, learn how to work with databases, endpoints and testing procedures. 
This project is a **fullstack web application** built with:  
- **Frontend:** React + Vite  
- **Backend:** Node.js + Express  
- **Database:** MongoDB

## üì¶ Frameworks & Libraries Used

- **Node.js**  
  JavaScript runtime environment that allows using JavaScript outside the browser to build backend components such as web servers, APIs, and databases.  
  Thanks to **NPM (Node Package Manager)**, you can install ready-to-use libraries.  

  - **Express**  
    Framework for Node.js that makes it easier to create web servers and APIs. It‚Äôs lightweight, flexible, and ideal for JavaScript backend projects.  
    It provides built-in functions for defining routes, handling requests, responses, and middlewares.  

  - **Jest**  
    JavaScript testing framework (created by Facebook/Meta) that makes writing automated tests simple.  
    It‚Äôs used to verify that the code works as expected.  

  - **Supertest**  
    Library for testing APIs and HTTP servers. Works well together with Jest and allows simulating HTTP requests (GET, POST, PUT, etc.)  
    to your endpoints without needing to run the real server.

**Architecture:**  
Frontend communicates with backend through REST API (`/api/...`).  
Backend connects to MongoDB and exposes data to the frontend.
